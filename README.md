# Celebrity_Wikimedia_Scraper

Purpose: Get not only images but also dates images were taken from wikimedia commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/)

For: Face images along with image date downloading. Ex: If you want to look at the aging of celebrities across years with AI.

How to use: Either directly modify "input_name" var in "wikimedia_webscraper.py" or specify a list of names in "celeb_list_execute.py". Then, depending on which one you input names into, execute that file.

Note: Yes, you may not that many images. But wikimedia is not like Google or Getty Images.
